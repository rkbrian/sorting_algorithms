# 0x01. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## General
 - At least four different sorting algorithms;
 - What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm;
 - How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input;
 - What is a stable sorting algorithm.

## Project List (Completed)
 - 0 Bubble sort
 - 1 Insertion sort (linked list)
 - 2 Selection sort
 - 3 Quick sort - Lomuto Partition scheme
 - 100 Shell sort
 - 101 Cocktail shaker sort (linked list)
 - 102 Counting sort
 - 106 Bitonic sort
 - 107 Quick sort - Hoare Partition scheme (final results work, but failed on details)
 - 1000 Dealer - sort a deck of cards (Hoare quick sort; allowed to use qsort() function, but I didn't)

## In all "number"-O files:
Big O notions of the time complexity in the each sort algorithm
- in the best case:
- in the average case:
- in the worst case:
